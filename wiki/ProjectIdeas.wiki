#summary Any and all ideas for the game

= Introduction =

If you have any ideas for this game, post them here. They could be something simple, like a character idea, or something complicated, like a new combat system. Just remember, if it is too big, and requires too much of a code rewrite, it probably won't be used. Feel free to edit this to add your idea to the list, and then leave comments about how you feel about each idea.
