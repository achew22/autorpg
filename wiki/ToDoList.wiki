= Introduction =

The following problems is mostly a step-by-step "what we need to fix" before we can start adding features. At the point where this code reconstruction is done, then features such as new characters, items, treasure chests, and doors can (and will) be added.


= Details =

===Problems to be fixed first:===
 * Reconstruction of the code:
  # ~~"`ClassDeclarations.h`" needs to be split into many different headers and each of the implementations need to be put into source files, instead of headers.~~ Done 12/5
  # ~~Graphics needs to be put into a class. This is just proper, and can reduce the number of globals that we are using, especially since every other class already stores it's own pointers to necessary screens.~~ Done 12/5 (but not shown yet in the SVN)
  # ~~The Global list of Dynamic Objects should be split into a few [linked?] lists:~~ Done 12/5 (but not shown yet in the SVN)
   * Characters (hero and enemies)
   * Things that characters can collide with (other than characters, walls?) (none of these exist yet)
   * Things that characters can interact with (chests, etc.) (none of these exist yet)
   * background stuff (torches)
  There shouldn't be any overlap between these lists. And then the Update() method of the Graphics namespace/class should be updated to update every list.

===Once these problems are fixed===
 # Add some new methods to the character class. Jump(), Attack(), and Interact() (which will open boxes, use doors, etc.) are a few that I can think of.
 # Doors should be added. More to come on the implementation of this.
 # An inventory should be added to the character, so that he can both carry and view items that he has.
 # Treasure chests should be added, presumably with treasure within them.
 # A combat system should be added. More to come on this later, as this will be the largest addition to the code.
 # Collision detection should be added. I haven't figured out a great way to do this yet, so your opinion is as good as mine.

==Eventually==

The whole thing will be automated, so we need some decent AI for the main character. This probably ought to wait until last, so that we know exactly what the AI needs to do, but this is just a heads up.
